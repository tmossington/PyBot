This is SERVO (Server Engagement and Response Virtual Operator), a discord.py bot that helps support my Discord server in a variety of ways. For now, development is still on-going, so his features are a bit sparse. Currently, PyBot can:

1. Scan for user greetings inside messages and give a friendly reply.
2. Scan for user goodbye messages and give a polite goodbye.
3. Return a random number if prompted.
