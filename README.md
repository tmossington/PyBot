This is SERVO (Server Engagement and Response Virtual Operator), a discord.py bot that helps support my Discord server in a variety of ways. For now, development is still on-going, so its features are a bit sparse. Currently, SERVO can:

1. Scan for user greetings inside messages and give a friendly reply.
2. Scan for user goodbye messages and give a polite goodbye.
3. Return a random number if prompted.
   
Planned future implementation:

Weather app functionality. Return current weather report for a specified city, zip code, or county.

Music app: play youtube videos through voice channel through a user requested queue system.

User statistics: return statistics about how many messages users have sent, average time spent in voice channels, etc.

Implement a user "level" or "points" system that rewards users with silly tokens or custom flairs.


This READme will be updated accordingly as features are added.
