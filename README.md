This is SERVO (Server Engagement and Response Virtual Operator), a discord.py bot that helps support my Discord server in a variety of ways. For now, development is still on-going, so its features are a bit sparse. Currently, SERVO can:

- Greets new members to the server

- Scan user messages to respond to certain prompts

- Return a random number if requestex

- Give a current weather report for a user-specified city or zip code

- Play Wordle




Planned future implementation and changes:

Improvements to the weather report:
1. Give addition information such as humidity
2. Return a forecast for the upcoming days.

Music app: play youtube videos through voice channel through a user requested queue system.

User statistics: return statistics about how many messages users have sent, average time spent in voice channels, etc.

Implement a user "level" or "points" system that rewards users with silly tokens or custom flairs.


This READme will be updated accordingly as features are added.
