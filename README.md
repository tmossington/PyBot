This is SERVO (Server Engagement and Response Virtual Operator), a discord.py bot that helps support my Discord server in a variety of ways. For now, development is still on-going, so features will be constantly edited and improved. Currently, SERVO can:

- Greets new members to the server

- Track User's server level and give XP for certain tasks

- Gives a daily report of the weather and top news stories of the day

- Scan user messages to respond to certain prompts

- Return a random number if requested

- Give a current weather report for a user-specified city or zip code

- Play Wordle and track user stats (wordle of the day and general game)

- Play guess the capital 

- Return the weather forecast for a specified city or zip code

- Return stock and crypto information

- And more!


This READme will be updated accordingly as features are added.
